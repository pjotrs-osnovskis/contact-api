# Contacts HTTP REST API Challenge

Welcome to my very first job offer challenge. My mission is to create a HTTP
REST API that would take in contact details and store them in a database. With
CRUD options as well.

Wish me best of luck, as at the point of writing this - I have no idea how to
do this! So let the game begin! 

I will be using Python and Flask Framework for this and MySQL for a database
working locally on Windows 10 machine.

As this is separate Python project, locally I am using Virtual Environment, to
keep all lib's and framework files separately, but added it to `.gitignore`
file, as those files are note necessary for others.

To install Flask I used command `pip3 install flask-restful`
